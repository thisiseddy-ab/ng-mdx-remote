# Use PrismJS Plugins

Plugins in PrismJS are powerful additional scripts and stylesheets (CSS) that extend the core functionality of the library, providing a wide array of features that enhance how code snippets are displayed and interacted with. These plugins are designed to be modular, meaning you can choose to include only the ones that are relevant to your needs, keeping the Prism Core lightweight and optimized for performance.

Many of these plugins are officially developed and maintained by the PrismJS team, ensuring compatibility and seamless integration with the core library. However, they are offered as separate plugins rather than being included in the core package. This modular approach allows developers to build a more customized and efficient setup, incorporating only the features they require without burdening their projects with unnecessary code.

## Line Highlight Plugin 

This plugin allows specific lines or ranges of lines to be highlighted, drawing attention to important parts of the code. It’s particularly useful in tutorials or examples where you want to emphasize certain sections.

To use the line highlight plugin that highlights specific lines and/or line ranges in code blocks, in addition to Prism.js configuration files, you will need to include the following files from prismjs/plugins/line-highlight directory to your application:

  * CSS styling for line highlight - prism-line-highlight.css
  * line highlight plugin script - prism-line-highlight.js


```typescript

// JS
import 'prismjs/plugins/line-highlight/prism-line-highlight';

// CSS
import 'prismjs/plugins/line-highlight/prism-line-highlight.css'

```

Using ng-mdx-remote-render component, you will be able to use the line_highlight property to activate the plugin.

Use line input property to specify the line(s) to highlight and optionally there is a lineOffset property to specify the starting line of code your snippet represents.


```html
  <ng-mdx-remote-render 
  [source]="mdxContent" 
  sourceType="string" 
  [options]="mdxOptions" 
  prismjs
  line_highlight
  [line]="'6, 10-16'"
  [lineOffset]="5"
  ></ng-mdx-remote-render>
```
### Here an Example using Line Highlight Plugin 

<ng-mdx-nested-code
prismjs
line_highlight
line="2-7, 15-20, 22-27"
>
```css
/* Basic CSS styling for a webpage */
body {
  background-color: #f0f0f0;
  font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
}

h1 {
  color: #333;
  text-align: center;
  margin-top: 50px;
}

p {
  color: #666;
  font-size: 18px;
  text-align: center;
  margin-top: 20px;
}

.container {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  height: 100vh;
}

```
</ng-mdx-nested-code>

## Line Numbers Plugin

This popular plugin adds line numbers to each line of the code block, making it easier for users to reference specific lines, particularly in educational content or documentation.

To use the line numbers plugin that shows line numbers in code blocks, in addition to Prism.js configuration files, you will need to include the following files from prismjs/plugins/line-numbers directory to your application:

  * CSS styling for line numbers - prism-line-numbers.css
  * line numbers plugin script - prism-line-numbers.js

```typescript

// JS
import 'prismjs/plugins/line-numbers/prism-line-numbers';

// CSS
import 'prismjs/plugins/line-numbers/prism-line-numbers.css';

```

Using ng-mdx-remote-render component, you will be able to use the line_numbers property to activate the plugin.

Additionally, you can use start input property to specify the offset number for the first display line.

```html
  <ng-mdx-remote-render 
  [source]="mdxContent" 
  sourceType="string" 
  [options]="mdxOptions" 
  prismjs
  line_numbers
  [start]="8"
  ></ng-mdx-remote-render>
```

### Here an Example using Line Number Plugin 

<ng-mdx-nested-code
prismjs
line_numbers
start="8"
>
```py

# Create a list of numbers and filter even and odd numbers using list comprehension
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]

# Filter even numbers
even_numbers = [num for num in numbers if num % 2 == 0]

# Filter odd numbers
odd_numbers = [num for num in numbers if num % 2 != 0]

# Calculate the sum of even and odd numbers
sum_even = sum(even_numbers)
sum_odd = sum(odd_numbers)
```
</ng-mdx-nested-code>


## Command Line Plugin 

The Command Line Plugin for PrismJS is a specialized extension designed to enhance the presentation of command-line interface (CLI) code snippets. This plugin simulates the look and feel of a terminal or command prompt, making it easier for users to distinguish between commands, output, and other elements typically seen in a CLI environment.

To use the command line plugin that displays a command line with a prompt and, optionally, the output/response from the commands, you will need to include the following files from prismjs/plugins/command-line directory to your application:

  * CSS styling for command line - prism-command-line.css
  * command line plugin script - prism-command-line.js

```typescript

// JS
import 'prismjs/plugins/command-line/prism-command-line';

// CSS
import 'prismjs/plugins/command-line/prism-command-line.css';

```

Using ng-mdx-remote-render component, you will be able to use the command_line property to activate the plugin.

You may also specify the lines to be presented as output (no prompt and no highlighting) through the output property in the following simple format:

  * A single number refers to the line with that number
  * Ranges are denoted by two numbers, separated with a hyphen (-)
  * Multiple line numbers or ranges are separated by commas
  * Whitespace is allowed anywhere and will be stripped off

```html
  <ng-mdx-remote-render 
  [source]="mdxContent" 
  sourceType="string" 
  [options]="mdxOptions" 
  prismjs
  command_line
  [user]="'chris'"
  [host]="'remotehost'"
  [output]="'2, 4-8'"
  ></ng-mdx-remote-render>
```

Maybe there's something wrong with my implementation or with the plugin, but you need to put this CSS in the global style.css file:

```css
ng-mdx-remote-render * .command,.output {
  display: block;
  float: left;
  font-size: 100%;
  letter-spacing: -1px;
  margin-right: 1em;
  pointer-events: none;
  text-align: right;
}
```

### Here Some Example using Command Line Plugin

<ng-mdx-nested-code
prismjs
command_line
user="root"
host="localhost"
>
```bash
cd /usr/local/etc
cp php.ini php.ini.bak
vi php.ini
```
</ng-mdx-nested-code>

<ng-mdx-nested-code
prismjs
command_line
user="chris"
host="remotehost"
output="2, 4-8"
>
```bash
pwd
/usr/home/chris/bin
ls -la
total 2
drwxr-xr-x   2 chris  chris     11 Jan 10 16:48 .
drwxr--r-x  45 chris  chris     92 Feb 14 11:10 ..
-rwxr-xr-x   1 chris  chris    444 Aug 25  2013 backup
-rwxr-xr-x   1 chris  chris    642 Jan 17 14:42 deploy
```
</ng-mdx-nested-code>

## DiffHighlight Plugin

- function oldFunction() {
+ // New function definition
+ function newFunction(param) {
   // Old function body
-   console.log(oldValue);
+   console.log(newValue, param);
 }
 
- // Old usage
- oldFunction();
+ // New usage
```
</ng-mdx-nested-code>

## Match Braces Plugin 

The Match Braces Plugin for PrismJS is a specialized extension designed to enhance the readability of code by visually emphasizing matching pairs of braces, brackets, and parentheses. This plugin is particularly useful for developers working with code that involves complex or nested structures, such as in programming languages like JavaScript, C++, or Python. By highlighting the corresponding pairs of these delimiters, the Match Braces Plugin helps users quickly identify and navigate through the logical structure of the code.

To use the Match Braces plugin that Highlights the matching braces, you will need to include the following files from prismjs/plugins/match-braces directory to your application:

  * CSS styling for line highlight - prism-match-braces.css
  * line highlight plugin script - prism-match-braces.js

```typescript

// JS
import 'prismjs/plugins/match-braces/prism-match-braces';

// CSS

```javascript
(defun factorial (n)
	(if (= n 0) 1
		(* n (factorial (- n 1)))))
```
</ng-mdx-nested-code>

## Normalize Whitespace Plugin
