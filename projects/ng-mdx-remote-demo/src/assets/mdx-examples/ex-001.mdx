# Hello, MDX!

Welcome to the world of MDX! This document will guide you through some of the core features and provide you with practical examples of how to use MDX effectively.

## Features

MDX combines Markdown and JSX, giving you the power to write rich content with dynamic components. Here are some of the primary features:

- **Markdown:** Write Markdown content directly within your MDX files. Markdown allows you to format text easily, including headers, lists, and links.

- **JSX Support:** Embed JSX components within your Markdown. This means you can include interactive elements, components, and other React features seamlessly within your content.

- **Component Integration:** Import and use React components directly in your MDX file. This feature makes it easy to create dynamic content without leaving your Markdown.

- **Code Highlighting:** MDX supports syntax highlighting for code blocks, making it easier to display code snippets with proper formatting and colors.

- **Layout Customization:** Customize the layout of your content by using components and styling. This gives you full control over how your content is presented.
