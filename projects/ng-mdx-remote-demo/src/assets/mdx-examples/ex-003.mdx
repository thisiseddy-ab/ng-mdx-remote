# Integrating Angular Components with Markdown

Angular components can be integrated into Markdown content by converting them into custom web components. This guide explains how to use Angular components within Markdown and provides examples of how to set it up.

## How to Use Angular Components in Markdown

### 1. **Automatic Conversion to Custom Elements**

Angular components are automatically converted into custom web components. This conversion is managed by the `NgMdxRemoteComponent` service, which utilizes Angular’s `createCustomElement` function. This function enables Angular components to be used as HTML elements in a manner compatible with standard web technologies.

**How It Works:**
- The `NgMdxRemoteComponent` service takes your Angular components and converts them into custom elements. This involves:
  - **Creating Custom Elements:** Using `createCustomElement`, the Angular component is wrapped and exposed as a standard web component (custom element).
  - **Registering Custom Elements:** The custom elements are registered with the browser, allowing them to be used in any HTML or Markdown content.

### 2. **Automatic Registration of Custom Elements**

Once the Angular components are converted into custom elements, they are automatically registered with the browser’s custom elements registry. This registration process ensures that the components can be used seamlessly within your Markdown files.

**How It Works:**
- The `NgMdxRemoteComponent` service takes care of:
  - **Defining Custom Elements:** The service registers the custom elements with the tag names specified, making them available for use in your Markdown content.
  - **Handling Lifecycle:** The custom elements are managed in a way that ensures they are properly initialized and rendered when used in Markdown or HTML content.

### Summary

In summary, the process of using Angular components in Markdown is streamlined and automated by the `NgMdxRemoteComponent` service. You do not need to manually convert or register Angular components; the service handles these tasks for you, allowing you to integrate dynamic Angular components directly into your Markdown content with minimal effort.

## Example Angular Components

Here are examples of Angular components and use them as custom elements in your Markdown content.

### 1. **Greeting Component**

The `Greeting` component offers a personalized greeting to the reader. This component is ideal for adding a personal touch to your content by addressing users directly.

<ng-greeting name="Edin Abdiu"/>

### 2. **Button Component**

The `Button` component creates a customizable button that can perform actions when clicked. This is perfect for adding interactive elements to your content, such as triggering events or handling user interactions.

<ng-button/>

### 3. **Info Card Component**

The `InfoCard` component displays information in a visually appealing card format. It can include an optional image, a title, and a description, making it ideal for highlighting key points or showcasing important content.


<ng-info-card 
  title="Learn MDX" 
  content="MDX allows you to combine Markdown with React components, providing a powerful way to create interactive documents."

### 4. **Alert Box Component**

The `AlertBox` component is used to display different types of alert messages, including informational, warning, and error messages. This component is useful for providing feedback or notifications within your content.

**Info Exaple**

<ng-alert-box 
  message="This is an info alert box." 
  type="info"
/>
